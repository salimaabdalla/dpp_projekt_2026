Top time series forecasting models include
classical statistical methods (ARIMA, ETS), machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM),
 and deep learning architectures (N-BEATS, Temporal Fusion Transformer). 
 Choice depends on data characteristics: ARIMA/Prophet suit univariate/seasonal data, 
 while DeepAR/LSTM/N-BEATS excel at complex, high-frequency, multivariate datasets. 

    Statistical Models (Best for simple/small data):
        ARIMA/SARIMA: The standard for stationary data with linear patterns.
        ETS (Exponential Smoothing): Excellent for trend and seasonal data.
        Prophet: Robust for business forecasting with multiple seasonalities (daily, weekly, yearly) 
        and holiday effects.
    Machine Learning Models (Best for structured, multivariate data):
        LightGBM / XGBoost: Fast, accurate, and suitable for tabular time series with complex nonlinear patterns.
        Random Forest: Effective for capturing complex non-linear relationships without heavy preprocessing.
    Deep Learning Models (Best for high-volume, long-term sequences):
        N-BEATS: Highly accurate for long-horizon forecasting, specifically designed for non-linearities.
        Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT): Google's model for interpreting complex, multi-horizon forecasts.
        DeepAR: Amazon's RNN-based probabilistic model for scaling to thousands of related time series.
        LSTM: Robust for long-term temporal dependencies.
    Emerging Models:
        TimeSNet: Specialized for long-range dependency modeling across multiple scales.
        TSMixer: Lightweight MLP-based model for large-scale, high-frequency data. 

Selection Guidance:

    Small Data/Short History: Use ARIMA, ETS, or Prophet.
    Large Dataset/High Frequency: Use LightGBM, LSTM, or N-BEATS.
    Long-Term Horizon: Use N-BEATS, TimesNet, or TFT.
    Multivariate with Complex Trends: Use TFT or DeepAR.
